# Unovis: Framework agnostic data visualization components
![](cover.png)

Unovis (ex @unovis/ts) is a collection of composable data visualization modules empowering the creation
of complex UI components for visual analytics.

The library is written in Typescript and can be used without a UI framework. We also provide React and Angular wrappers
for a smoother dev experience.


## Installation
Unovis is available on F5 Artifactory.

If you want to use it with React, install both `@unovis/ts` and `@unovis/react`:
```bash
npm install -P @unovis/ts @unovis/react
```

If you use Angular, install `@unovis/angular` instead:
```bash
npm install -P @unovis/ts @unovis/angular
```

Or if you want to use it with vanilla TypeScript or JavaScript, only the core package will be needed:
```bash
npm install -P @unovis/ts
```

## Usage
Check the library's website documentation and usage examples. More learning resources coming soon!
