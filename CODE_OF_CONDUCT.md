# Open Source Code of Conduct

## Preface

_Unovis_ values a healthy community where people feel psychologically
safe in knowing others, working with tech, and contributing to our project.
We recognize human interpersonal dynamics can be tricky, so we are codifying
our guidelines on behavior and interactions with one another.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project
and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of
age, body size, neuro(a)typicality, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics,
gender identity and expression, level of experience, education level,
socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion,
or sexual identity and orientation. We strive for technological excellence,
which is found where individuals feel psychologically safe when interacting
with one another, contributing to the community, and supporting each other
in education and use of our technology. We pledge to act and interact in ways
that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy
community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community, and prioritizing marginalized people's safety
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
* The use of violent language or imagery
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission (doxxing)
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting
* Unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, or employment

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at _f5_oss_conduct@f5.com_. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response
that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project
team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter
of an incident , commit to confidentiality when requested, commit to
reasonable response time, and transparency around following steps.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply
immediately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
