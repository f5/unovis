## Requirements
Minimum requirements: [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (v7 or above)
and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v12 or above).

## Installing Dependencies

Once you clone and open the repo in the IDE of your choice, first install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If any dependency-related issues arise, try a clean install:
```bash
npm run install:clean
```

## Local Development
### Demo App
If you're making changes to the core library `@unovis/ts`, we recommend creating at least one example using our local demo app to visually test your changes.
Add the example to `packages/dev/src/examples` in the appropriate category folder.

To start the development server for the demo app, run the command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Website
To start the development server for the website, run the command:

```bash
npm run website
```

### Framework Apps
Each framework wrapper* has a demo app to verify our [gallery](../gallery) examples work as expected.
To run the app for a specific framework, navigate to that directory within `packages` and run the command:

```bash
npm run gallery
```
