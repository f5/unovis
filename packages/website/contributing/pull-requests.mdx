## Rebasing
Before creating a pull request, make sure your branch is up-to-date with the main branch.
We recommend rebasing your branch on the main branch to avoid merge conflicts and keep the commit history clean.

```bash
git checkout main && git pull
git checkout <your-branch> && git rebase main
git push --force
```

## Commit Messages
Commits should have the following format:

```bash
git commit -m "<type> | <scope>: <subject>"
```

Rules:
- **type** can be any of the following:  
  `Core`, `Component`, `Container`, `Utils`, `Styles` - for core library changes  
  `Angular`, `React`, `Svelte`, `Vue` - for wrapper related changes  
  `Website` - for changes related to website content  
  `Dev`, `Shared` - for changes to the demo app, dev tools or integrations  
  `CI` - for CI/CD pipeline related changes  
  `Release` - for release commits  
  `Misc` - anything else


- **scope** should be the name of the component or feature being worked on in _PascalCase_
- Additional **scope** values can be added with ` | ` delimiter
- **subject** is a short description of the change in _Sentence case_
- A reference `<#issue>` may also be provided on the next line
- No leading or trailing whitespace in the header

:::note
- Scope is optional but encouraged for all types except `CI` or `Release`
- For `Component` type, scope should be one of the component names
:::

Some examples:

```bash
"Core | Utils: Refactoring shape rendering helpers"
"Component | Timeline: Fixing enter transition bug"
"Dev | Build: Upgrading rollup dependency"
"React | Autogen: Tweaking component lifecycle logic"
"Release: 1.4.0"
