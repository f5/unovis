Unovis 1.3 introduces [Vue](http://vuejs.org) support and a new pattern theme to further improve our support for accessibility features.

## Release Highlights
### üéâ Vue 3 support
Long-awaited support for Vue, the third most popular front-end UI framework. Kudos to our community member [@zernonia](https://github.com/zernonia) for this amazing [contribution](https://github.com/f5/unovis/pull/272)!

### üë®‚Äçüé® Patterns
A new theme with pattern fills that can be enabled by adding the `theme-patterns` class to the `body` element of your document. See the [documentation](http://localhost:9300/docs/guides/theming#applying-patterns) and [this pull request](https://github.com/f5/unovis/pull/275) for more details.
