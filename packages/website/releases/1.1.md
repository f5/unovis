### 🥨  New component: Multi-Level Chord Diagram
  _Multi-Level Chord Diagram_ can display hierarchical relationships and interactions between multiple entities, often used to visualize complex systems or networks. It showcases the flow of data or connections between different levels, allowing users to understand the intricacies of interconnected components and their relative importance within the system.

### 👋 Goodbye `lodash`
  _Unovis_ doesn't have `lodash` as it's dependency anymore saving precious 90KB (unzipped) of your app bundle!
