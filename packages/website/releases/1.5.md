Version `1.5` of _Unovis_ has arrived! This release is packed with enhancements,
including full support for Solid; compatibility with React 19 and Angular 19;
many Graph component tweaks; exciting new features; and numerous bug fixes.

## Release Highlights
### 🎉 Solid Support
_Unovis_ now works with Solid — one of the most performant JSX frameworks. Thanks to [@hngngn](https://github.com/hngngn) for this amazing [contribution](https://github.com/f5/unovis/pull/469)!

### 🎊  React 19 and Angular 19
_Unovis_ now also support Angular 19 and React 19. <br />
Calling for Svelte 5 support contribution ([discussion](https://github.com/f5/unovis/issues/500))! Huge thanks to [@pingu-codes](https://github.com/pingu-codes) for your incredible help with Svelte support! 🚀.

A ton of new features were added to _Graph_:

- Provide your own functions to render nodes allowing you to highly customize how the graph looks ([docs](/docs/networks-and-flows/Graph#custom-rendering-15)).

- Post-Layout ([docs](/docs/networks-and-flows/Graph#post-layout-customization-15)) and Post-Render Customization ([docs](/docs/networks-and-flows/Graph#post-render-customization-15)) allowing you to modify the layout of the graph on the fly and render additional layers with D3.

- Provide custom SVG icon to link labels ([docs](/docs/networks-and-flows/Graph#labels-updated-in-15)).

- Zoom start/end and node dragging callbacks ([docs](/docs/networks-and-flows/Graph#pan--zoom--drag)).

- Fit view to specific nodes by providing an array of node ids.

- Multiple node selection ([docs](https://unovis.dev/docs/networks-and-flows/Graph#multiple-node-drag)).

- Enable _Graph_ nodes to accept precalculated layout data  ([docs](https://unovis.dev/docs/networks-and-flows/Graph#precalculated)).


### 🪧 Tooltip

*Tooltip* now can be anchored to the target element, can be hovered over, and supports dynamic content (updates if the content changes) ([docs](/docs/auxiliary/Tooltip#follow-cursor)).

### 📏 Axis

Axis now automatically hides overlapping labels ([docs](/docs/auxiliary/Axis#hide-overlapping-ticks-15)) and supports label rotation ([docs](/docs/auxiliary/Axis#label-rotation)).

### 🔵 Bullet Legend
You can set the orientation of _Bullet Legend_ to `'vertical'` ([docs](/docs/auxiliary/BulletLegend#orientation)).
