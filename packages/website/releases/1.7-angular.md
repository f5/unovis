## Overview

Effective with the next major release (1.7) of Unovis, we will only support Angular versions that are currently in Long-Term Support (LTS) as defined by [Angular's version support policy](https://angular.dev/reference/versions).

## What This Means

Angular follows a predictable release cycle where each major version receives:
- **6 months** of active support (regular updates and patches)
- **12 months** of long-term support (critical fixes and security patches)
- After 18 months, versions reach end-of-life

Unovis will support all Angular versions currently in their LTS window. As Angular versions reach end-of-life, Unovis will drop support for those versions in our next minor release.

## Current Status

Currently, Unovis supports Angular versions **12 through 19** (`"@angular/common": "12 - 19"` in our peer dependencies). Moving forward, we will only support Angular versions that are in active support or LTS.

## Why This Change?

1. **Security**: Unsupported Angular versions no longer receive security updates, which can pose risks to applications
2. **Modern Features**: Allows us to leverage newer Angular features and APIs (standalone components, signals, improved TypeScript support, etc.)
3. **Maintenance Efficiency**: Reduces the testing matrix and allows our team to focus on supporting current Angular versions with better quality
4. **Industry Standard**: This aligns with how other major Angular libraries (Angular Material, NgRx, etc.) manage version support

## Timeline

- **Effective Date**: Next major version release of Unovis
- **Transition Period**: Current versions of Unovis will continue to support the existing range until the next major release

## What You Should Do

1. **Check Your Angular Version**: Run `ng version` to see which Angular version you're using
2. **Plan Your Upgrade**: If you're using an Angular version that's approaching end-of-life, plan to upgrade
3. **Stay Informed**: Follow [Angular's release schedule](https://angular.dev/reference/versions) to know when versions enter and exit LTS
