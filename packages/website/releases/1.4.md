Version `1.4.0` of _Unovis_ is finally here! This update is packed full with enhancements including
the new Annotations component, expanded Graph features, and a number of bug fixes to improve overall
stability of the library.

## Release Highlights
### üìù New component: Annotations
Introducing _Annotations_, a versatile new component that enables you to overlay customized, stylized text on top of your visualizations. Whether you want to highlight points of interest, annotate trends, or simply add text labels to your charts or graphs, _Annotations_ is designed to integrate smoothly with any Unovis component. 

Check out _Annotations_'s [documentation](/docs/auxiliary/Annotations) and [gallery example](/gallery/view?collection=Auxiliary%20Components&title=Chart%20Annotations) to learn how to use it.

### üîó Graph Link Curvature and SVG Icons
A number of features were added to _Graph_ in this [PR](https://github.com/f5/unovis/pull/322), including link curvature configuration, the ability to use custom SVGs as node icons, and support for longer link labels. Check out the [docs](https://unovis.dev/docs/networks-and-flows/Graph) for a deep dive into the latest enhancements or to explore the breadth of features Graph
has to offer.
