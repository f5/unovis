## Adding a new component

### Intro
First, it is essentiaSVG vs HTML components
  - Consider generics/expected data types

### Make the skeleton files in `@unovis/ts`
  - Create the files in a newly created `<component-name>` directory
  - Base/minimum files needed: `index`, `config`, and `style`
    - Description of each + how they interact with each other (i.e `index` extends class def in `config` uses static selectors field `s` from `style`)
  - Any custom types should go in `types`
  - Extraneous logic/functions should go in a `modules` directory
  
### Writing the rest of the component code
  - The render function
    - Brief description of enter/merge/exit transitions
  - Adding a dev example
  - General style guide/other recommendations

- Update the `@unovis/angular`, `@unovis/react` and `@unovis/svelte` wrappers
  - Add component to `autogen` and run `generate` command

- Write a doc page
  - General outline of doc:
    - Basic configuration
    - More detailed explanations of properties
    - Events
    - CSS Variables
    - Prop Table
  - Relevant components
    - DocWrapper
    - PropsTable

- Make a gallery example
  - Description of required files
  - Add to examples list to test
  - Don't forget screenshots for the gallery thumbnail
  - Verify  the example works in each framework

- Final step: complete the CLA and create a pull request
