## Welcome to Unovis

This documentation will help you to get comfortable with *Unovis* â€” a modular and platform-agnostic library for charts, maps and graphs.

### Installation
Unovis is available on F5 Artifactory. If you want to use it with React, install both `@volterra/vis` and `@volterra/vis-react`:
```bash
npm install -P @volterra/vis @volterra/vis-react
```

If you use Angular, install `@volterra/vis-angular` instead:
```bash
npm install -P @volterra/vis @volterra/vis-angular
```

Or if you want to use it with vanilla TypeScript or JavaScript, only the core package will be needed:
```bash
npm install -P @volterra/vis
```


### Usage
Pick a component on the left to learn how to configure it (start with <Link to="/docs/xy-charts/Line">Line</Link> if you
want a simple example). Or check the <Link to="https://f5-innersourcing.pages.gitswarm.f5net.com/unovis/showcase">Showcase</Link>
section to see what's the library is capable of.
