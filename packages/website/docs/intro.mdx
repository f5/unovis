## Welcome to Unovis

This documentation will help you to get comfortable with *Unovis* â€” a modular and platform-agnostic library for charts, maps and graphs.

### Installation
Unovis is available on F5 Artifactory as an NPM package. The core package `@volterra/vis` is written in TypeScript,
and compiled to JavaScript. So you can use it in any TypeScript or JavaScript project.

Before installing Unovis you'll probably need to set its registry explicitly:
```bash
npm config set @volterra:registry https://artifactory.f5net.com/artifactory/api/npm/f5-volterra-vis-npm/
```

After that you can run the command below to install the library:
```bash
npm install -P @volterra/vis
```

If you're using a UI framework, we recommend installing a dedicated adaptor as well, it will make your work with
Unovis much more enjoyable:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="react" label="React" default>

```bash
npm install -P @volterra/vis @volterra/vis-react
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="angular" label="Angular">

```bash
npm install -P @volterra/vis @volterra/vis-angular
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="svelte" label="Svelte">

```bash
npm install -P @volterra/vis @volterra/vis-svelte
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Usage
Pick a component on the left to learn how to configure it (start with <Link to="/docs/xy-charts/Line">Line</Link> if you
want a simple example). Or check the <Link to="https://f5-innersourcing.pages.gitswarm.f5net.com/unovis/showcase">Showcase</Link>
section to see what's the library is capable of.
